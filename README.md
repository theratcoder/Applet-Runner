# Applet Runner
This is a simple program that launches the Java Applet Viewer. It's designed to help people use old Java applets that don't function in modern browers.
## How to use
In order to use this program, you must first have installed JDK 7 or older (8 might work, but the important thing is that you have a version that includes the appletviewer program). Once you have that, download Applet Runner.exe from releases, double-click to run it, and that's all!
## MacOS version?
There is a macOS version under releases. I seem to have lost the actual source code for it, but I still have the app itself. As with the Windows version, you need to have the correct JDK version installed or it won't work.
